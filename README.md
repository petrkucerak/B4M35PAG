# Paraleln√≠ algoritmy - B4M35PAG

In the introductory lectures, we will focus on general approaches to design of parallel algorithms and their properties important for understanding the fundamental principles of parallel and distributed algorithms. Subsequently, we will talk about fundamental parallel algorithms; typically constituting cornerstones of algorithms for real-world problems. The laboratory exercises will be aimed at hardware platform commonly used in practice (multi-core CPUs).
